# üìÇ OSP Assignment 3 - Memory Allocation
Built by Ryan Comerford (s3945787)

## üöß Building
- Compile all using `make all`.
- Compile only the first fit program using `make firstfit`.
- Compile only the best fit program using `make bestfit`.
- __Ensure c++ 20 features are enabled using `scl enable devtoolset-11 bash`.__

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ First Fit Allocation Strategy Program
``` bash
./firstfit [input_file]
```

- input_file: the file from which to read alloc/dealloc commands.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Best Fit Allocation Strategy Program
``` bash
./bestfit [input_file]
```

- input_file: the file from which to read alloc/dealloc commands.
